### Summary of Changes and Order of Implementation:

**Already Implemented in the Above Code:**

1. **Separate Training and Prediction Phases**:  
   - `train_model.py` exclusively trains the model and saves it.  
   - `predict_dips.py` loads the trained model and only performs prediction.

2. **Optimize Time Management for Candle Updates**:  
   - Implemented `get_time_until_next_candle()` to dynamically calculate sleep time.

3. **Implement a Logging System**:  
   - Added a `logging` configuration at the start of both scripts.
   - Logs are written to `dip_detection.log` and `model_training.log`.

4. **Optimize Feature Engineering**:  
   - Basic optimization in place; further improvements can be made by incrementally updating rolling computations.

5. **Make Dip Threshold Configurable**:  
   - Introduced `config.py` with `DIP_THRESHOLD`.

6. **Use a Static Training Dataset**:  
   - The code has a `TODO` comment in `train_model.py` to use a static dataset.
   - Once you have a static dataset, you can remove the MT5 data fetching and rely solely on the dataset for training.

### If You Cannot Implement All at Once (TODO):

If integrating all these changes at once is too complicated, you can follow this step-by-step approach:

**TODO Steps:**
1. **Step One**: Create a separate training script (train_model.py) that saves the model and scaler. Use a static dataset or fetch historical data.
2. **Step Two**: Modify the original script to load the pre-trained model and scaler only for prediction (predict_dips.py).
3. **Step Three**: Add logging to both scripts to track the flow and errors.
4. **Step Four**: Implement dynamic waiting logic for candle updates.
5. **Step Five**: Introduce a configuration file (config.py) to manage thresholds and paths.
6. **Step Six**: Optimize feature engineering and ensure that training uses a static, consistent dataset.

By breaking down the process, you can gradually achieve a better workflow without being overwhelmed by changes all at once.
